# The Ocky Way 🥪🥙🍳

Welcome to The Ocky Way Application! This Java-based project is designed to streamline and automate the order process for a DELIcious custom sandwich shop. Say goodbye to paper orders, and embrace the efficiency of a digital solution.

## Class Diagram 📊

Before diving into the code, a class diagram was created to outline the relationships between various classes and interfaces. This diagram serves as a blueprint for the project's structure, ensuring a coherent implementation. Refer to the diagram in the repository for a visual representation.

## User Stories 📝

User stories are concise, user-centric descriptions of a feature or functionality in a software system. They capture the requirements from the perspective of end-users and are often written in plain language. Each user story represents a piece of functionality that delivers value to the user.

Here are a few examples!

These stories are a fundamental component of Agile development methodologies, such as Scrum. They serve as a communication tool between stakeholders, including product owners, developers, and testers. Before the project can begin, we must know what we need in order to move forward!

## The Set Up 💻🖱

1. Clone the Repository:

2. Compile and run the 'theOckyWay.java' file


3. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the application:

    For adding sandwiches, drinks, and chips, you will be prompted to answer a series of questions such as topings, flavors, and the corresponding amount.

## Technologies Used ⚙ ⚒ 

1) **Java:**  The core programming language used for developing the application. Java's versatility and object-oriented features contribute to the robustness of the codebase.


2) **Object Oriented Analysis and Design (OOP):** OOP principles are employed throughout the development process, ensuring a modular and scalable architecture. Classes and interfaces are used to model the components of the system.


3) **IntelliJ IDEA (or Eclipse):** Utilized IntelliJ IDEA as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding, debugging, and project management. The features of the IDE enhance productivity and code quality.


4) **Git:** Utilized Git as the version control system for tracking changes, managing branches, and enabling collaborative development.

## Future Work ➡⏲💻🖥

* **User Interface Enhancements:**
      
  * Improve the user interface for a more intuitive and visually appealing experience. Consider incorporating graphics, images, and a user-friendly layout to enhance the overall aesthetic of the application.
  

* **Database Integration:**

  *   Implement a database to store and manage order data. This will enable DELIcious to keep track of customer orders, preferences, and sales data over time. It can also facilitate reporting and analytics for business insights.


* **User Accounts and Order History:**

   *  Introduce user accounts to allow customers to create profiles, save favorite orders, and view order history. This feature enhances customer loyalty and provides a personalized experience.


* **Feedback and Rating System:**

  *  Incorporate a feedback and rating system to gather customer opinions. This information can be valuable for continuous improvement, and positive feedback can be highlighted as testimonials on the online platform.


## Resources 📚📑

1) **Stack Overflow:** Utilized Stack Overflow for troubleshooting and problem-solving during the development process. The platform's vast community and repository of questions and answers were invaluable in overcoming technical challenges and improving the codebase.


2) **Class Diagram:** The class diagram (as seen above) provides a visual representation of the application's architecture, illustrating the relationships and interactions between different classes. It served as a blueprint for designing the object-oriented structure of the project, ensuring a modular and scalable solution.


3) **GitHub Repository:**  The repository served as the central hub for collaboration, version control, and documentation of the project.
